## About
I implemented a version of the Arkanoid game, as part of the OOP course i took during my bachelor degree.</br>
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.</br>
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:
* Polymorphism and inheritance.
* Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
* Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
* Working with GUI.

## Dependencies
* Windows / Linux / macOS
* Git
* Keyboard that contains: Spacebar (for stoppage), "P" button, and all arrows.
* Apache Ant
